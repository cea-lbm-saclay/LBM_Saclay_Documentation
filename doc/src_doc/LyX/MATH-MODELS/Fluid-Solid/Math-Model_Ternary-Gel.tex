\section{Mathematical model}

In this model we are concerned with the diffusion of three components
$A$, $B$ and $C$ of compositions $C_{A}$, $C_{B}$ and $C_{C}$.
The compositions are conserved and the following relationship holds:

\[
C_{A}+C_{B}+C_{C}=1
\]


\subsection{Phase-field equation}

\[
\tau\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}=W^{2}\boldsymbol{\nabla}^{2}\phi-\omega_{dw}^{\prime}(\phi)-\lambda p^{\prime}(\phi)\Delta\omega(\boldsymbol{\mu})
\]

where $\tau$ is the relaxation time, $W$ is the interface width,
$\omega_{dw}^{\prime}(\phi)$ is the derivative of the double-well
potential with respect to $\phi$ which is defined by

\[
\omega_{dw}(\phi)=8\phi^{2}(1-\phi)^{2}
\]
$\lambda$ is the coupling parameter, $p^{\prime}(\phi)$ is the derivative
of an interpolation function with respect to $\phi$:

\[
p(\phi)=\phi^{2}(3-2\phi)
\]

and $\Delta\omega(\boldsymbol{\mu})$ is defined by

\[
\Delta\omega(\boldsymbol{\mu})=
\]

Let us notice that the parameters $\tau$ can be expressed by thermodynamic
properties (height of double-well and coefficient of proportionnality
in factor of $\delta\Omega/\delta\phi$). Finally in the ``.ini``
input file, the usual parameters $W$ and $M_{\phi}$ are set.

\section{Compositions equations}

\[
\frac{\partial C_{A}}{\partial t}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left[D_{A}(\phi)C_{A}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mu_{A}\right]
\]

\[
\frac{\partial C_{B}}{\partial t}=\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left[D_{B}(\phi)C_{B}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mu_{B}\right]
\]

The last composition is obtained by Eq. 

\[
C_{C}=1-C_{A}-C_{B}
\]


\subsection{Chemical potential}

\[
\mu_{A}=\log\left[\frac{C_{A}}{\phi e^{-\epsilon_{A}^{l}}+(1-\phi)e^{-\epsilon_{A}^{s}}}\right]
\]

\[
\mu_{B}=\log\left[\frac{C_{B}}{\phi e^{-\epsilon_{B}^{l}}+(1-\phi)e^{-\epsilon_{B}^{s}}}\right]
\]
